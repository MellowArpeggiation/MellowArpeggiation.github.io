# Portfolio for Mellow Arpeggiation

## Built with Gatsby

I selected Gatsby for this project because it is a React framework that compiles pages into regular HTML, which is great for non-interactive pages that need to be ultra-fast.

To build and run this repository, you'll need to install node_modules dependencies:

```
npm ci
```

Then start the watcher so that you can preview the site and see your changes in real-time:

```
npm run develop
```

To deploy your changes to a new branch (in this case called "public") so that you can use this with gh-pages

```
npm run deploy
```
