Oh easy, make sure you include jQuery first
```js
var value1 = 1,
    value2 = 1;

if (value1 != undefined && value2 != undefined && $(value1).is($(value2))) {
    // W00t?
}
```

### Comments
Downvoted, you should never use `undefined`! Direct comparisons against `undefined` are troublesome as `undefined` can be overwritten, completely breaking your code! You can't risk this, nor can you trust anyone!!

value1 =value2

To find out whether or not two numbers are equal we must first determine how these numbers are stored...

I checked Stack Overflow to see if they had a reasonable answer to this question, and unsurprisingly they didn't have anything good.

I can't stand Stack Overflow. As someone who has a PhD in Software Engineering, I can't tell you the number of times I've banged my head against the wall, asking questions there from time to time. Like how do I get proper exchange of data from a Java server to a C# client's readbytes. It's a harder question than it sounds, but you get some 15 year old kid closing your question as a duplicate.

To me, most people have problems reading at a college level, so to discourage someone from programming because the moderator wants to feel superior, is deplorable.

Besides, learning is messy business. It looks messy, it feels messy, and it can be painful to look at. SO directly hurts education and severely limits knowledge, due to their need for drawing within the lines. More laws and rules are not what people need.

You could argue that it's a private site and it has a right to act that way, but when you spam Google search results, with clean but mostly unhelpful code it kills efficiency in finding the right answer or direction.

Anyway, here is a working answer

```js
var value1 = Number(1);
var value2 = Number(1);

if (!isNaN(value1) && !isNaN(value2) && value1 === value2) {
    // Did I also mention I have a PhD??
}
```
