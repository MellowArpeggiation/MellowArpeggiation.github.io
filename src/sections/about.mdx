## About the developer

Aspiring designer/developer with a taste for the functional and minimal, with 10+ years of experience in programming and design. Has an eye for details, and an awareness of the whole. Will unrelentingly refactor your code, and reason changes in comments with great verbosity.

Currently working at Web Force 5 as the Lead Developer for the Continuum Division. We're really good at websites so check us out!
