## Repair Sharepoint apps after theme change

On SharePoint, if you change the theme of an App on the App Catalog, or change a theme of a site that contains an Apps, all the Apps in the App Catalog will fail catastrophically.

This script is a quick fixme that requires zero configuration, just upload it to the SharePoint server and run it to repair the App Catalog entirely.

```powershell
#!/usr/local/bin/pwsh

## This little number automatically fixes that annoying app breaking bug to do with themes
## If an app is complaining about being unable to open a file, run me on the SP server


# Add the sharepoint snapin to the current session
Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.Sharepoint.Powershell

# Get the app prefix
$prefix = Get-SPAppSiteSubscriptionName
# Use the app prefix to get all app urls
$allappurls = Get-SPSite | Get-SPWeb -Limit All | where {$_.url -like "http://$prefix*"}

foreach ($app in $allappurls)
{
    # Loop through all apps within the default site with the app prefix of $prefix
	$name = $app.name
	$app.CustomMasterUrl = "/$name/_catalogs/masterpage/app.master"
	$app.MasterUrl = "/$name/_catalogs/masterpage/app.master"
	$app.Update()
    echo "Updating masterpage for $app"
}
```
